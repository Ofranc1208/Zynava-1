# PART ONE: BRAND VISION & PRODUCT ECOSYSTEM

---

## Brand Overview

### The Name

**ZYNAVA** (Z-Y-N-A-V-A)

A premium wellness brand that fuses ancient animal symbolism with modern nutritional science. The name evokes vitality, precision, and elevated performance.

### Mission Statement

> ZYNAVA exists to help humans perform at their peak across every terrain of life — cardiovascular endurance, mental clarity, digestive balance, restorative sleep, and structural resilience. We believe the animal kingdom holds timeless wisdom about survival and dominance. Each ZYNAVA supplement channels that wisdom into science-backed formulations that strengthen the systems that matter most.

### Brand Positioning

ZYNAVA is not a commodity supplement brand. It is a **premium wellness ecosystem** built on three pillars:

1. **Animal Symbolism** — Each product category is represented by an animal that dominates its terrain through specific biological advantages. These animals become icons, not mascots.

2. **Scientific Integrity** — Every formulation is backed by research, premium ingredients, and transparent dosing. No proprietary blends. No fillers. No gimmicks.

3. **Elevated Experience** — From packaging to education to the advisor experience, ZYNAVA feels like a luxury brand that happens to sell supplements.

### Brand Values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Precision** | Every ingredient, every dose, every claim — intentional |
| **Power** | Supplements that deliver real, noticeable results |
| **Wisdom** | Learning from nature's millions of years of optimization |
| **Clarity** | No confusion, no hype — just clean information |
| **Confidence** | Products you're proud to display, routines you trust |

---

## The Animal Symbol System

### Philosophy

Animals survive and dominate in their terrain because of specific biological traits — endurance, circulation, resilience, clarity, calm focus. ZYNAVA supplements help humans strengthen those same systems.

Each animal is chosen for its **symbolic alignment** with a human health terrain. These are not cartoons or mascots — they are **icons** representing peak performance in their domain.

### Visual Direction

- **Treatment:** High-contrast, minimal, confident
- **Mood:** Timeless, premium, adult-focused

| **Color Palette** | Deep navy, warm gold, crisp white, accent earth tones |
| **Animal Treatment** | Bold silhouettes, not realistic illustrations |
| **Label Style** | Vintage poster meets modern minimal |
| **Finish** | Matte with selective gloss on icon |

| Homepage content | Domain-specific (supplements vs settlements) |
| Product pages | New domain (products vs calculators) |
| Calculators | Not needed for supplements |
| State/County law pages | Not relevant |
| All domain content | Different business |

## 3. 2025 Best Practices & Improvements

> **This section addresses flaws in the reference repo and applies modern standards**

### 🔴 Issues in Reference Repo We're Fixing

#### Issue 1: TypeScript/ESLint Errors Ignored

**Reference repo (BAD):**
```javascript
// next.config.js
typescript: { ignoreBuildErrors: true },
eslint: { ignoreDuringBuilds: true },
```

**Our approach (GOOD):**
```javascript
// next.config.js
typescript: { ignoreBuildErrors: false }, // STRICT - no TS errors allowed
eslint: { ignoreDuringBuilds: false },    // STRICT - no lint errors allowed
```

**Implementation:**
- Pre-commit hooks with Husky to catch errors early
- CI pipeline fails on any TypeScript error
- Stricter tsconfig settings

#### Issue 2: Mixed Styling Approaches

**Reference repo:** Mixes Tailwind, CSS modules, inline styles, global CSS inconsistently.

**Our approach:** **Inline styles only** (per your preference), with consistent patterns:
```typescript
// Consistent style object pattern
const styles = {
  container: {
    maxWidth: '1200px',
    margin: '0 auto',
    padding: '24px',
  },
  heading: {
    fontSize: 'clamp(1.5rem, 3vw, 2rem)',
    fontWeight: '700',
    color: '#1f2937',
  },
} as const;

// Usage
<div style={styles.container}>
  <h1 style={styles.heading}>Title</h1>
</div>
```

#### Issue 3: Too Much Client-Side Rendering

**Reference repo:** Many pages use `'use client'` unnecessarily, hurting SEO.

**Our approach:** **Server Components by default**
```typescript
// GOOD - Server Component (default)
// app/products/[slug]/page.tsx
export default async function ProductPage({ params }: Props) {
  const product = await getProduct(params.slug); // Server-side fetch
  return <ProductDetails product={product} />;
}

// Only use 'use client' when needed (interactivity)
// src/components/product/AddToCart.tsx
'use client';
export function AddToCart({ productId }: Props) {
  // Interactive cart logic
}
```

#### Issue 4: No Input Validation

**Reference repo:** API routes accept unvalidated input.

**Our approach:** **Zod validation on all inputs**
```typescript
// src/lib/validation/product.ts
import { z } from 'zod';

export const addToCartSchema = z.object({
  productId: z.string().min(1),
  quantity: z.number().int().positive().max(99),
});

// app/api/cart/route.ts
import { addToCartSchema } from '@/src/lib/validation/product';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const result = addToCartSchema.safeParse(body);
  
  if (!result.success) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: result.error.flatten() }, { status: 400 });
  }
  
  // Safe to use result.data
}
```

**2. Enhanced robots.txt for AI crawlers**
```typescript
// app/robots.ts
export default function robots(): MetadataRoute.Robots {
  return {
    rules: [
      // AI Search Bots - ALLOW
      { userAgent: 'GPTBot', allow: '/', disallow: ['/api/', '/admin/', '/checkout/'] },
      { userAgent: 'ChatGPT-User', allow: '/', disallow: ['/api/', '/admin/', '/checkout/'] },
      { userAgent: 'PerplexityBot', allow: '/', disallow: ['/api/', '/admin/', '/checkout/'] },
      { userAgent: 'ClaudeBot', allow: '/', disallow: ['/api/', '/admin/', '/checkout/'] },
      { userAgent: 'Google-Extended', allow: '/', disallow: ['/api/', '/admin/', '/checkout/'] },
      // Traditional crawlers
      { userAgent: 'Googlebot', allow: '/', disallow: ['/api/', '/admin/', '/checkout/'] },
      { userAgent: 'Bingbot', allow: '/', disallow: ['/api/', '/admin/', '/checkout/'] },
      // Default
      { userAgent: '*', allow: '/', disallow: ['/api/', '/admin/', '/checkout/'] },
    ],
    sitemap: 'https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml',
  };
}
```

#### Enhanced Product Schema (E-Commerce Optimized)

```typescript

      priceCurrency: 'USD',
      price: (product.price / 100).toFixed(2),
      priceValidUntil: new Date(Date.now() + 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString().split('T')[0],
      availability: product.inStock 
        ? 'https://schema.org/InStock'

    nutrition: product.ingredients ? {
      '@type': 'NutritionInformation',
      servingSize: product.servingSize,
    } : undefined,
  };
}
```

#### Image Sitemap for Products

```typescript
// app/sitemap-images.ts
import { MetadataRoute } from 'next';
import { getAdminDb } from '@/lib/firebase-admin';

export default async function imageSitemap(): Promise<MetadataRoute.Sitemap> {
  const db = getAdminDb();
  const products = await db.collection('products').where('status', '==', 'active').get();
  
  return products.docs.map(doc => {
    const product = doc.data();
    return {
      url: `https://yourdomain.com/products/${product.slug}`,
      images: product.images.map((img: any) => ({
        url: img.url,
        title: img.alt || product.name,
        caption: product.shortDescription,
      })),
    };
  });
}
```

---

### 🟢 Performance Best Practices

#### Server Components Strategy

```
Page Structure (Default = Server Component):

ProductPage (Server) ─── fetches data, renders SEO content
├── ProductGallery (Server) ─── static images, good for SEO
├── ProductDetails (Server) ─── description, ingredients, SEO text
├── AddToCart (Client) ─── needs interactivity
├── ReviewsList (Server) ─── static review content
│   └── ReviewForm (Client) ─── form interactivity
└── RelatedProducts (Server) ─── static, good for SEO
```

#### Streaming with Suspense

```typescript
// app/products/[slug]/page.tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react';

export default async function ProductPage({ params }: Props) {
  const product = await getProduct(params.slug);
  
  return (
    <main>
      {/* Critical content loads immediately */}
      <ProductGallery images={product.images} />
      <ProductDetails product={product} />
      <AddToCart productId={product.id} />
      
      {/* Reviews stream in after */}
      <Suspense fallback={<ReviewsSkeleton />}>
        <ReviewsList productId={product.id} />
      </Suspense>
      
      {/* Related products stream last */}
      <Suspense fallback={<RelatedSkeleton />}>
        <RelatedProducts category={product.category} />
      </Suspense>
    </main>
  );
}
```

#### ISR with On-Demand Revalidation

```typescript
// app/products/[slug]/page.tsx
export const revalidate = 3600; // Revalidate every hour

// app/api/revalidate/route.ts - Call this when product updates
import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const { secret, path } = await request.json();
  
  if (secret !== process.env.REVALIDATION_SECRET) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Invalid secret' }, { status: 401 });
  }
  
  revalidatePath(path);
  return NextResponse.json({ revalidated: true });
}
```

### 🟢 Cart State Management (Simple but Solid)

Using localStorage for simplicity, but with proper patterns:

```typescript
// src/hooks/useCart.ts
'use client';

import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';

interface CartItem {
  productId: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
  image: string;
}

interface CartState {
  items: CartItem[];
  total: number;
}

const CART_KEY = 'supplement-cart';

export function useCart() {
  const [cart, setCart] = useState<CartState>({ items: [], total: 0 });
  const [isLoaded, setIsLoaded] = useState(false);

  // Load cart from localStorage on mount
  useEffect(() => {
    const stored = localStorage.getItem(CART_KEY);
    if (stored) {
      try {
        setCart(JSON.parse(stored));
      } catch {
        localStorage.removeItem(CART_KEY);
      }
    }
    setIsLoaded(true);
  }, []);

  // Persist cart to localStorage
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isLoaded) {
      localStorage.setItem(CART_KEY, JSON.stringify(cart));
    }
  }, [cart, isLoaded]);

  const addItem = useCallback((item: Omit<CartItem, 'quantity'>) => {
    setCart(prev => {
      const existing = prev.items.find(i => i.productId === item.productId);
      
      if (existing) {
        return {
          items: prev.items.map(i =>
            i.productId === item.productId
              ? { ...i, quantity: i.quantity + 1 }
              : i
          ),
          total: prev.total + item.price,
        };
      }
      
      return {
        items: [...prev.items, { ...item, quantity: 1 }],
        total: prev.total + item.price,
      };
    });
  }, []);

  const removeItem = useCallback((productId: string) => {
    setCart(prev => {
      const item = prev.items.find(i => i.productId === productId);
      if (!item) return prev;
      
      return {
        items: prev.items.filter(i => i.productId !== productId),
        total: prev.total - (item.price * item.quantity),
      };
    });
  }, []);

  const updateQuantity = useCallback((productId: string, quantity: number) => {
    if (quantity < 1) return removeItem(productId);
    
    setCart(prev => {
      const item = prev.items.find(i => i.productId === productId);
      if (!item) return prev;
      
      const diff = quantity - item.quantity;
      
      return {
        items: prev.items.map(i =>
          i.productId === productId ? { ...i, quantity } : i
        ),
        total: prev.total + (diff * item.price),
      };
    });
  }, [removeItem]);

  const clearCart = useCallback(() => {
    setCart({ items: [], total: 0 });
  }, []);

  const itemCount = cart.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.quantity, 0);

  return {
    items: cart.items,
    total: cart.total,
    itemCount,
    isLoaded,
    addItem,
    removeItem,
    updateQuantity,
    clearCart,
  };
}
```

**Future upgrade path:** When ready for server-side cart, replace this hook internals without changing the interface.

### 🟢 Error Handling & Observability

#### Global Error Boundary

```typescript
// app/error.tsx
'use client';

import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Error({
  error,
  reset,
}: {
  error: Error & { digest?: string };
  reset: () => void;
}) {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Log to error tracking service (Sentry, etc.)
    console.error('Application error:', error);
  }, [error]);

  return (
    <div style={{ padding: '48px', textAlign: 'center' }}>
      <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '16px' }}>Something went wrong</h2>
      <p style={{ color: '#6b7280', marginBottom: '24px' }}>
        We're sorry for the inconvenience. Please try again.
      </p>
      <button
        onClick={reset}
        style={{
          backgroundColor: '#10b981',
          color: 'white',
          padding: '12px 24px',
          borderRadius: '8px',
          border: 'none',
          cursor: 'pointer',
        }}
      >
        Try again
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Not Found Page

```typescript
// app/not-found.tsx
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function NotFound() {
  return (
    <div style={{ padding: '48px', textAlign: 'center' }}>
      <h1 style={{ fontSize: '4rem', fontWeight: '700', color: '#10b981' }}>404</h1>
      <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '16px' }}>Page not found</h2>
      <p style={{ color: '#6b7280', marginBottom: '24px' }}>
        The page you're looking for doesn't exist or has been moved.
      </p>
      <Link
        href="/"
        style={{
          backgroundColor: '#10b981',
          color: 'white',
          padding: '12px 24px',
          borderRadius: '8px',
          textDecoration: 'none',
        }}
      >
        Go home
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

### 🟢 Pre-commit Quality Gates

#### Husky + lint-staged Setup

```bash
npm install -D husky lint-staged
npx husky init
```

```json
// package.json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{ts,tsx}": [
      "eslint --fix",
      "prettier --write"
    ]
  }
}
```

```bash
# .husky/pre-commit
npm run lint-staged
npm run type-check
```

This ensures **no TypeScript errors or lint issues** ever make it to the repo.

---

### 🟢 Upgrade Paths (For Later)

When you're ready to upgrade, here's how:

| Current | Upgrade To | Effort | How |
|---------|------------|--------|-----|
| localStorage cart | Server-side cart | 2-3 hours | Add API routes, keep hook interface |
| Guest checkout | User accounts | 4-6 hours | Add Firebase Auth, account pages |
| Firestore blog | Sanity CMS | 4-6 hours | Install Sanity, migrate content |
| Next.js 14 | Next.js 15 | 1-2 hours | Update deps, enable PPR |
| Inline styles | Tailwind | Gradual | Add Tailwind, migrate per-component |

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

```

### Step 2: Firebase Client Config

**Reuse pattern from `app/utils/firebase.ts`:**

```typescript
// src/lib/firebase/client.ts
import { initializeApp, getApps, getApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';
import { getStorage } from 'firebase/storage';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID,
};

// Singleton pattern - prevent re-initialization
const app = !getApps().length ? initializeApp(firebaseConfig) : getApp();

export const db = getFirestore(app);
export const storage = getStorage(app);
export { app };

// Lazy load auth (prevents blocking - from reference repo optimization)
let authInstance: any = null;
export function getAuthInstance() {
  if (!authInstance && typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    const { getAuth } = require('firebase/auth');
    authInstance = getAuth(app);
  }
  return authInstance;
}
```

### Step 3: Firebase Admin Config

**Reuse pattern from `lib/firebase-admin.ts`:**

```typescript
// lib/firebase-admin.ts
import admin from 'firebase-admin';

let isInitialized = false;

function initializeFirebaseAdmin() {
  // Skip during build
  if (process.env.NEXT_PHASE === 'phase-production-build') {
    return;
  }

  if (isInitialized || admin.apps.length > 0) {
    return;
  }

  try {
    if (process.env.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT) {
      const serviceAccount = JSON.parse(process.env.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT);
      admin.initializeApp({
        credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount),
      });
      isInitialized = true;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Firebase Admin initialization failed:', error);
  }
}

// Lazy getters
export function getAdminDb() {
  initializeFirebaseAdmin();
  if (!admin.apps.length) throw new Error('Firebase Admin not initialized');
  return admin.firestore();
}

export function getAdminAuth() {
  initializeFirebaseAdmin();
  if (!admin.apps.length) throw new Error('Firebase Admin not initialized');
  return admin.auth();
}

export default admin;
```

### Step 4: Auth Plan (Optional)

**For guest checkout (recommended to start):**
- No auth required
- Store order by email
- Optional account creation post-purchase

**For member accounts:**
- Firebase Auth with email/password
- Social login (Google, Facebook)
- Protected routes for `/account/*`

### Step 5: Firestore Rules

**Development rules (permissive for testing):**

```javascript
// firestore.rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Products - public read, admin write
    match /products/{productId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.admin == true;
    }
    
    // Categories - public read, admin write
    match /categories/{categoryId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.admin == true;
    }
    
    // Reviews - public read, authenticated write
    match /reviews/{reviewId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if true; // Or require auth
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.admin == true;
    }
    
    // Orders - owner or admin only
    match /orders/{orderId} {
      allow create: if true; // Created by API route with admin SDK
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
        (request.auth.uid == resource.data.customerId || request.auth.token.admin == true);
    }
    
    // Leads - admin only
    match /leads/{leadId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.admin == true;
    }
    
    // Chat - public create, admin read
    match /chatConversations/{chatId} {
      allow create: if true;
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.admin == true;
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Hosting/Deploy (Vercel + Firebase)

**Safe patterns from reference:**
1. Firebase Admin only in API routes and server components
2. Environment variables set in Vercel dashboard
3. Use `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` as JSON string (not file path)
4. Never import `firebase-admin` in client components

## 8. Checkout Plan (2 Options)

### Option A: Stripe Checkout (Recommended for Speed)

**Why Stripe:**
- Fastest to implement
- PCI compliant out of the box
- Handles payment UI, validation, fraud
- Supports subscriptions if needed later

**Implementation Steps:**

#### 1. Install Stripe

```bash
npm install stripe @stripe/stripe-js
```

#### 2. API Route for Checkout Session

```typescript
// app/api/checkout/stripe/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import Stripe from 'stripe';
import { getAdminDb } from '@/lib/firebase-admin';

const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!, {
  apiVersion: '2024-11-20.acacia',
});

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const { items, email, shippingAddress } = await request.json();

    // Create line items for Stripe
    const lineItems = items.map((item: any) => ({
      price_data: {
        currency: 'usd',
        product_data: {
          name: item.name,
          images: [item.image],
        },
        unit_amount: item.price, // Price in cents
      },
      quantity: item.quantity,
    }));

    // Create Stripe Checkout Session
    const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
      mode: 'payment',
      payment_method_types: ['card'],
      line_items: lineItems,
      customer_email: email,
      shipping_address_collection: {
        allowed_countries: ['US'],
      },
      success_url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/checkout/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
      cancel_url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/cart`,
      metadata: {
        // Store reference data
        cartItems: JSON.stringify(items.map((i: any) => ({ id: i.id, qty: i.quantity }))),
      },
    });

    return NextResponse.json({ sessionId: session.id, url: session.url });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Stripe checkout error:', error);
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Checkout failed' }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

#### 3. Webhook for Order Creation

```typescript
// app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import Stripe from 'stripe';
import { getAdminDb } from '@/lib/firebase-admin';

const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!);

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const body = await request.text();
  const signature = request.headers.get('stripe-signature')!;

  let event: Stripe.Event;

  try {
    event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
      body,
      signature,
      process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET!
    );
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Invalid signature' }, { status: 400 });
  }

  if (event.type === 'checkout.session.completed') {
    const session = event.data.object as Stripe.Checkout.Session;
    
    // Create order in Firestore
    const db = getAdminDb();
    const orderRef = db.collection('orders').doc();
    
    await orderRef.set({
      id: orderRef.id,
      orderNumber: `ORD-${Date.now()}`,
      email: session.customer_email,
      stripeSessionId: session.id,
      stripePaymentIntentId: session.payment_intent,
      paymentStatus: 'paid',
      fulfillmentStatus: 'unfulfilled',
      total: session.amount_total,
      // ... other order fields
      createdAt: new Date(),
      updatedAt: new Date(),
    });
  }

  return NextResponse.json({ received: true });
}
```

#### 4. Client-side Checkout Button

```typescript
// src/components/checkout/CheckoutButton.tsx
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';
import { loadStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-js';

const stripePromise = loadStripe(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY!);

export function CheckoutButton({ items }: { items: CartItem[] }) {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  const handleCheckout = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    
    const response = await fetch('/api/checkout/stripe', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ items }),
    });
    
    const { url } = await response.json();
    
    // Redirect to Stripe Checkout
    window.location.href = url;
  };

  return (
    <button
      onClick={handleCheckout}
      disabled={loading}
      style={{
        backgroundColor: '#10b981',
        color: 'white',
        padding: '16px 32px',
        borderRadius: '8px',
        fontSize: '1rem',
        fontWeight: '600',
        cursor: loading ? 'not-allowed' : 'pointer',
      }}
    >
      {loading ? 'Processing...' : 'Checkout with Stripe'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

---

### Option B: Lead Capture Checkout (CRM Style)

**Why Lead Capture:**
- No payment processing setup
- Good for high-touch sales
- Collect interest, follow up manually
- Lower friction initial launch

**Implementation Steps:**

#### 1. Lead Capture Form Component

```typescript
// src/components/checkout/LeadCaptureForm.tsx
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export function LeadCaptureForm({ items }: { items: CartItem[] }) {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    firstName: '',
    lastName: '',
    email: '',
    phone: '',
    notes: '',
  });
  const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);

  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    
    const response = await fetch('/api/checkout/lead', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        ...formData,
        interestedProducts: items,
        estimatedTotal: items.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.price * i.quantity, 0),
      }),
    });
    
    if (response.ok) {
      setSubmitted(true);
    }
  };

  if (submitted) {
    return (
      <div style={{ textAlign: 'center', padding: '48px' }}>
        <h2>Thank You!</h2>
        <p>We'll contact you within 24 hours to complete your order.</p>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* Form fields */}
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="First Name"
        value={formData.firstName}
        onChange={(e) => setFormData({ ...formData, firstName: e.target.value })}
        required
      />
      {/* ... other fields */}
      <button type="submit">Request Quote</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

#### 2. Lead API Route

```typescript
// app/api/checkout/lead/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { getAdminDb } from '@/lib/firebase-admin';
import { sendLeadNotificationEmail } from '@/lib/email';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const leadData = await request.json();
    
    const db = getAdminDb();
    const leadRef = db.collection('leads').doc();
    
    await leadRef.set({
      id: leadRef.id,
      ...leadData,
      status: 'new',
      source: 'website',
      createdAt: new Date(),
      updatedAt: new Date(),
    });
    
    // Send notification email to sales team
    await sendLeadNotificationEmail(leadData);
    
    return NextResponse.json({ success: true, leadId: leadRef.id });
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Failed to create lead' }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

### Tradeoffs Summary

| Aspect | Stripe Checkout | Lead Capture |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Speed to launch** | 2-3 hours | 1 hour |
| **Revenue timing** | Immediate | Delayed |
| **User experience** | Full self-service | Requires follow-up |
| **Complexity** | Medium (webhooks) | Low |
| **Best for** | Consumer products | High-value, B2B |

**Recommendation:** Start with **Stripe Checkout** for a consumer supplement site. It provides the best user experience and immediate revenue.

## 9. Chatbot Plan

### Current State in Reference Repo

The reference repo has a **complete chat system** in `src/components/chat/`:
- `ChatInterface.tsx` - Main chat UI
- `ChatBubble.tsx` - Message bubbles
- `WelcomeScreen.tsx` - Initial greeting
- `ChatController.tsx` - Chat logic orchestration
- `SmartInputBar/` - Input with file upload support

**This is highly reusable!**

### Adaptation Plan

#### 1. Chat UI Location

```
src/components/chat/
├── ChatWidget.tsx          # Floating chat button + drawer
├── ChatInterface.tsx       # REUSE from reference
├── ChatBubble.tsx          # REUSE from reference
├── WelcomeScreen.tsx       # ADAPT for supplements
├── ProductRecommendation.tsx # NEW: Inline product cards
└── FAQQuickReplies.tsx     # NEW: Pre-set questions
```

#### 2. Store Conversations

**Firestore collection (reuse pattern from reference):**

```typescript
// Collection: chatConversations
{
  id: string;
  sessionId: string;
  messages: Message[];
  productsDiscussed: string[];
  outcome: 'purchase' | 'support' | 'abandoned';
  createdAt: Timestamp;
}
```

#### 3. OpenAI API Route

**Reuse pattern from `app/api/openai/run-analysis/route.ts`:**

```typescript
// app/api/chat/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import OpenAI from 'openai';
import { getAdminDb } from '@/lib/firebase-admin';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are a helpful supplement advisor for [Brand Name]. 
Your role is to:
- Answer questions about supplements, ingredients, and usage
- Recommend products based on customer goals
- Provide dosage information and best practices
- Direct complex health questions to healthcare professionals

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS:
- Always recommend consulting a healthcare provider before starting supplements
- Do not make medical claims or diagnose conditions
- Clearly state that supplements are not intended to treat diseases

Product Catalog Context:
{productCatalog}
`;

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const { messages, sessionId } = await request.json();
    
    // Fetch product catalog for context
    const db = getAdminDb();
    const productsSnapshot = await db.collection('products')
      .where('status', '==', 'active')
      .limit(50)
      .get();
    
    const products = productsSnapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
      name: doc.data().name,
      category: doc.data().category,
      description: doc.data().shortDescription,
      price: doc.data().price / 100,
    }));
    
    const systemPrompt = SYSTEM_PROMPT.replace(
      '{productCatalog}',
      JSON.stringify(products, null, 2)
    );
    
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
      messages: [
        { role: 'system', content: systemPrompt },
        ...messages,
      ],
      temperature: 0.7,
      max_tokens: 500,
    });
    
    const assistantMessage = response.choices[0].message.content;
    
    // Store conversation
    await db.collection('chatConversations').doc(sessionId).set({
      messages: [...messages, { role: 'assistant', content: assistantMessage }],
      updatedAt: new Date(),
    }, { merge: true });
    
    return NextResponse.json({ message: assistantMessage });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Chat error:', error);
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Chat failed' }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

#### 4. Product-Aware Retrieval Strategy

**Phase 1 (Basic - Week 1):**
- Include full product catalog in system prompt
- Works for <50 products

**Phase 2 (Better - Week 2+):**
- Implement RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Embed products in vector store
- Retrieve relevant products based on query
- Use Pinecone or Firebase Vector Search

#### 5. Guardrails (Medical Claims)

```typescript
// src/lib/chat/guardrails.ts
export const MEDICAL_DISCLAIMER = `
⚠️ IMPORTANT: This information is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice. 
Please consult with a healthcare professional before starting any supplement regimen.
`;

export const BLOCKED_TOPICS = [
  'cure',
  'treat disease',
  'diagnose',
  'prescription',
  'medical condition',
];

export function sanitizeResponse(response: string): string {
  let sanitized = response;
  
  // Check for blocked claims
  for (const topic of BLOCKED_TOPICS) {
    if (response.toLowerCase().includes(topic)) {
      sanitized += '\n\n' + MEDICAL_DISCLAIMER;
      break;
    }
  }
  
  return sanitized;
}
```

## 10. SEO Plan (Enhanced for 2025)

> **See Section 3 for enhanced product schemas, AI crawler optimization, and llms.txt setup**

### Current SEO Assets (Highly Reusable)

The reference repo has **excellent SEO infrastructure**:

| Component | Location | Reuse |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Metadata generator | `lib/seo/metadata.ts` | ✅ As-is |
| StructuredData component | `src/components/SEO/StructuredData.tsx` | ✅ As-is |
| JSON-LD schemas | `src/lib/structured-data/` | 🔄 Extend |
| Sitemap generation | `app/sitemap.ts` | 🔄 Adapt |
| Robots.txt | `app/robots.ts` | ✅ As-is |
| SEO content blocks | `src/components/SEO/SEOContentBlock.tsx` | 🔄 Adapt |

### Metadata Templates

**Reuse `lib/seo/metadata.ts` pattern:**

```typescript
// lib/seo/metadata.ts
export function generateMetadata(options: MetadataOptions): Metadata {
  // ... existing implementation
}

// NEW: Product page metadata
export function generateProductMetadata(product: Product): Metadata {
  return generateMetadata({
    title: `${product.name} | Buy Online`,
    description: product.shortDescription,
    path: `/products/${product.slug}`,
    ogType: 'product',
    ogImage: product.images[0]?.url,
  });
}

// NEW: Category page metadata
export function generateCategoryMetadata(category: Category): Metadata {
  return generateMetadata({
    title: `${category.name} Supplements | Shop All`,
    description: category.description,
    path: `/categories/${category.slug}`,
  });
}

// NEW: Blog post metadata
export function generateBlogMetadata(post: BlogPost): Metadata {
  return generateMetadata({
    title: post.title,
    description: post.excerpt,
    path: `/blog/${post.slug}`,
    ogType: 'article',
    article: {
      publishedTime: post.publishedAt?.toISOString(),
      author: post.author.name,
      tags: post.tags,
    },
  });
}
```

### JSON-LD Schemas for E-Commerce

**Extend `src/lib/structured-data/` with new schemas:**

```typescript
// src/lib/structured-data/product.ts
export function generateProductSchema(product: Product) {
  return {
    '@context': 'https://schema.org',
    '@type': 'Product',
    name: product.name,
    description: product.description,
    image: product.images.map(i => i.url),
    sku: product.sku,
    brand: {
      '@type': 'Brand',
      name: 'Your Brand Name',
    },
    offers: {
      '@type': 'Offer',
      url: `https://yoursite.com/products/${product.slug}`,
      priceCurrency: 'USD',
      price: (product.price / 100).toFixed(2),
      availability: product.inStock 
        ? 'https://schema.org/InStock' 
        : 'https://schema.org/OutOfStock',
      seller: {
        '@type': 'Organization',
        name: 'Your Brand Name',
      },
    },
    aggregateRating: product.reviewCount > 0 ? {
      '@type': 'AggregateRating',
      ratingValue: product.averageRating.toFixed(1),
      reviewCount: product.reviewCount,
    } : undefined,
  };
}

// Product List schema for category pages
export function generateProductListSchema(products: Product[], categoryName: string) {
  return {
    '@context': 'https://schema.org',
    '@type': 'ItemList',
    name: `${categoryName} Products`,
    itemListElement: products.map((product, index) => ({
      '@type': 'ListItem',
      position: index + 1,
      item: {
        '@type': 'Product',
        name: product.name,
        url: `https://yoursite.com/products/${product.slug}`,
      },
    })),
  };
}
```

### Sitemap Generation

**Adapt `app/sitemap.ts` pattern:**

```typescript
// app/sitemap.ts
import { MetadataRoute } from 'next';
import { getAdminDb } from '@/lib/firebase-admin';

export default async function sitemap(): Promise<MetadataRoute.Sitemap> {
  const baseUrl = 'https://yoursite.com';
  const db = getAdminDb();
  
  // Static pages
  const staticPages: MetadataRoute.Sitemap = [
    { url: baseUrl, changeFrequency: 'daily', priority: 1.0 },
    { url: `${baseUrl}/products`, changeFrequency: 'daily', priority: 0.9 },
    { url: `${baseUrl}/about`, changeFrequency: 'monthly', priority: 0.7 },
    { url: `${baseUrl}/contact`, changeFrequency: 'monthly', priority: 0.7 },
    { url: `${baseUrl}/faq`, changeFrequency: 'weekly', priority: 0.7 },
    { url: `${baseUrl}/blog`, changeFrequency: 'daily', priority: 0.8 },
  ];
  
  // Dynamic product pages
  const productsSnapshot = await db.collection('products')
    .where('status', '==', 'active')
    .get();
  
  const productPages = productsSnapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
    url: `${baseUrl}/products/${doc.data().slug}`,
    lastModified: doc.data().updatedAt?.toDate(),
    changeFrequency: 'weekly' as const,
    priority: 0.8,
  }));
  
  // Dynamic category pages
  const categoriesSnapshot = await db.collection('categories')
    .where('status', '==', 'active')
    .get();
  
  const categoryPages = categoriesSnapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
    url: `${baseUrl}/categories/${doc.data().slug}`,
    lastModified: doc.data().updatedAt?.toDate(),
    changeFrequency: 'weekly' as const,
    priority: 0.85,
  }));
  
  // Dynamic blog pages
  const blogSnapshot = await db.collection('blog')
    .where('status', '==', 'published')
    .get();
  
  const blogPages = blogSnapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
    url: `${baseUrl}/blog/${doc.data().slug}`,
    lastModified: doc.data().updatedAt?.toDate(),
    changeFrequency: 'monthly' as const,
    priority: 0.7,
  }));
  
  return [...staticPages, ...productPages, ...categoryPages, ...blogPages];
}
```

### Canonical Rules

1. **Product pages:** Self-referencing canonical
2. **Category pages with pagination:** Canonical to page 1
3. **Filtered/sorted pages:** Canonical to unfiltered version
4. **Blog pages:** Self-referencing canonical
5. **www vs non-www:** Redirect to preferred (set in Vercel)

### Performance Notes

**From reference repo patterns:**

1. **Image Optimization:**
   - Use Next.js `<Image>` component
   - Serve WebP/AVIF formats (configured in `next.config.js`)
   - Lazy load below-fold images

2. **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration):**
   ```typescript
   // Product pages - revalidate every hour
   export const revalidate = 3600;
   ```

3. **Caching Headers:**
   - Already configured in `next.config.js` and `vercel.json`
   - Static assets: 1 year cache
   - API responses: Consider stale-while-revalidate

4. **Core Web Vitals:**
   - Vercel Speed Insights already integrated
   - Web Vitals tracking in `src/components/Analytics/`

### E-E-A-T & Expert Attribution (Compliance-Safe)

> **Learned from SmarterPayouts implementation — January 2025**

For YMYL (Your Money Your Life) content like health/supplements, Google prioritizes **E-E-A-T signals** (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness). Here's how to implement safely:

#### Team-Based Attribution (Recommended)

Use **team names instead of individuals** to avoid unverifiable credential claims:

```typescript
// lib/content/experts.ts
export const experts = [
  {
    slug: 'zynava-team',
    name: 'ZYNAVA Team',
    title: 'Wellness Specialists',
    credentials: [
      'Supplement Industry Experience',
      'Consumer-First Formulation Approach',
    ],
    bio: 'The ZYNAVA team is dedicated to creating premium, science-backed supplements. Content is for informational purposes only.',
  },
  {
    slug: 'editorial-team',
    name: 'ZYNAVA Editorial Team',
    title: 'Content Review',
    credentials: [
      'Health & Wellness Research',
      'Consumer Education Focus',
    ],
    bio: 'Our editorial team reviews all content for accuracy and clarity. Content does not constitute medical advice.',
  },
  {
    slug: 'formulation-team',
    name: 'ZYNAVA Formulation Team',
    title: 'Product Development',
    credentials: [
      'Supplement Formulation Experience',
      'Quality Assurance Standards',
    ],
    bio: 'Our formulation team develops and tests all ZYNAVA products. All claims are based on ingredient research.',
  },
];
```

#### ReviewedBy Component

```typescript
// src/components/ExpertAttribution/ReviewedBy.tsx
export function ReviewedBy({ expert, reviewDate }) {
  return (
    <div itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/Organization">
      <p>
        <strong>Reviewed by </strong>
        <span itemProp="name">{expert.name}</span>, {expert.title}
      </p>
      <p>{expert.credentials.join(' • ')}</p>
      <p>Last updated: {formatDate(reviewDate)}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### ⚠️ Compliance Rules — NEVER Claim:

| ❌ DON'T Claim | ✅ DO Claim Instead |
|----------------|---------------------|
| "Licensed Nutritionist" | "Nutrition Research Experience" |
| "Board Certified" | "Industry Experience" |
| "Dr. [Name]" (unless verified) | "ZYNAVA Research Team" |
| "FDA Approved" | "Made in FDA-registered facility" |
| "Clinically Proven" | "Ingredient research suggests..." |
| "Cures/Treats [condition]" | "Supports [body system]" |
| "Medical Advice" | "For informational purposes only" |

#### Required Disclaimers

Add to every product page and content page:

```typescript
const HEALTH_DISCLAIMER = `
  *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. 
  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. 
  Consult your healthcare provider before starting any supplement regimen.
`;
```

#### Person Schema (Team-Based)

```typescript
// For team attribution (safer than individual)
export function generateTeamSchema(team) {
  return {
    '@context': 'https://schema.org',
    '@type': 'Organization',  // Use Organization, not Person
    name: team.name,
    description: team.bio,
    parentOrganization: {
      '@type': 'Organization',
      name: 'ZYNAVA',
      url: 'https://zynava.com',
    },
  };
}
```

### Long-Term SEO Dominance Strategy

> **3 highest-leverage moves for competing in health/supplement space**

#### 1. Indexation Discipline

Don't index every page — only index pages with unique, valuable content:

```typescript
// lib/seo/pageQualityScore.ts
export function shouldIndexPage(page): boolean {
  let score = 0;
  
  if (page.hasUniqueContent) score += 30;
  if (page.hasProductSchema) score += 20;
  if (page.hasReviews) score += 20;
  if (page.wordCount >= 500) score += 15;
  if (page.hasImages) score += 10;
  if (page.hasVideo) score += 5;
  
  return score >= 50; // Only index high-quality pages
}
```

#### 2. Non-Paraphrase Uniqueness

Add structural elements that can't be copied by paraphrasing:

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Dosage Calculator** | Interactive tool | "Calculate your daily dose" |
| **Comparison Tables** | Structured data | "ZYNAVA vs Competitors" |
| **Ingredient Breakdown** | Unique content | Per-ingredient analysis |
| **Usage Timeline** | Visual guide | "When to take each supplement" |

#### 3. Entity Building (Long-term)

Build trust signals over time:

- **Reviews:** Target 100+ reviews on Google, Trustpilot
- **Backlinks:** Guest posts on health/wellness blogs
- **Mentions:** PR coverage, influencer mentions
- **Certifications:** GMP, NSF, third-party testing badges
