## 🎯 What ZYNAVA Is

**ZYNAVA is an AI-powered supplement advisor platform that helps users find the right supplements based on their personal wellness goals, not brand marketing.**

Think of ZYNAVA as **"Trivago for Supplements"** — we don't sell products directly. Instead, we:

1. **Analyze 30,000+ supplement products** using our proprietary Z-SCORE™ algorithm
2. **Match users with personalized recommendations** based on their goals, demographics, and preferences
3. **Route users to trusted retailers** (iHerb, Amazon, brand sites) where they can purchase
4. **Earn affiliate commissions** when users make purchases through our links

### Core Value Proposition

- **For Users:** Get personalized supplement recommendations based on ingredient quality, not marketing budgets
- **For Creators:** Earn attribution and track performance when driving traffic to ZYNAVA
- **For Retailers:** Receive qualified, high-intent traffic from users who've completed a detailed wellness quiz

## 🧠 How ZYNAVA Works

### The User Journey

1. **User completes a 6-step quiz** covering:
   - Wellness goals (8 options: overall health, immunity, energy, bone/joint, heart health, gut health, sleep/stress, brain health)
   - Demographics (age, gender)
   - Activity level (8 lifestyle options)
   - Dietary preferences (vegan, gluten-free, kosher, halal, etc.)
   - Specific health concerns (goal-specific options)
   - Shopping preferences (budget-friendly, premium quality, subscriptions, etc.)

2. **Z-SCORE™ Algorithm processes the data:**
   - **Phase 1: The Sieve** - Filters 30,000 products down to ~100-500 candidates using hard filters (ingredient match, dietary compliance, safety, availability)
   - **Phase 2: The Scorer** - Ranks candidates using a 100-point scoring system:
     - Ingredient quality & dosage (0-35 points)
     - Goal alignment (0-15 points)
     - Demographic fit (0-15 points)
     - Activity level match (0-10 points)
     - Brand quality & reviews (0-15 points)
     - Dietary bonus (0-10 points)
     - Safety penalties (0-20 points deducted)
   - **Phase 3: Vendor Optimizer** - Finds best prices and promotions across multiple retailers
   - **Phase 4: Diversity** - Ensures top 5 recommendations cover different ingredient categories (builds stacks, not synonym lists)

3. **User receives top 5 personalized recommendations** with:
   - Z-SCORE™ rating (0-100)
   - Ingredient analysis and dosage information
   - Price comparison across vendors
   - Safety information and cautions
   - Links to purchase from trusted retailers

4. **User clicks through to retailer** and makes purchase (if desired)

### The Technology

- **Z-SCORE™ Algorithm:** Proprietary scoring system that evaluates supplements at the ingredient level
- **Ingredient Intelligence:** Deep knowledge base of 100+ supplement ingredients, their benefits, optimal dosages, and safety profiles
- **Multi-Vendor Price Comparison:** Real-time price and promotion tracking across iHerb, Amazon, and brand sites
- **Safety Layer:** Demographic-based filtering to prevent dangerous recommendations (e.g., no high-iron supplements for post-menopausal women)
